Format-o-Matic was a paper originally presented at SESUG 2017.  The paper was co-authored with Marcus Maher (Ipsos Public Affairs) as the lead author.

The paper describes a macro that creates SAS Formats from a dataset, and suggests uses for formats beyond the printed page; in particular, using formats to merge datasets, and to simplify grouping data in reports.
