Labelling without the Hassle was presented at the 2014 Midwest SAS Users Group forum (MWSUG 2014).

The concepts covered were mostly replaced by the same-year release of SAS 9.4 TS1M2, which included new options for labelling stacked bar charts, but can still be relevant for programmers with SAS 9.3, and the general approach may be useful for other problems not fully implemented in SGPLOT yet.
